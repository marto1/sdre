Goal expression description language

goals define what the generation must strive for:
	  <goal exp> ::= [[<constant>*] " "  [<placeholder>*]*]

constants = words/bytes that must be present:
	  <constant> ::= <content>

placeholders define free slots for words:
	  <placeholder> ::= "."



simple example:
       'expressions' . 'rule!' -> expressions really rule!
